## 1. Project Idea Definition

Kenya’s wildlife faces significant threats due to poaching, illegal wildlife trafficking, and habitat destruction. Despite ongoing efforts, challenges persist in coordinating anti-poaching operations efficiently, managing patrol schedules, recording incidents, and monitoring wildlife populations. Rangers often arrive too late at poaching sites, making enforcement reactive rather than preventive. Additionally, human-wildlife conflicts and the demand for land for agriculture and settlement exacerbate the problem.

The proposed Anti-Poaching Effort Management System aims to address these issues by creating a centralized database for Kenyan wildlife reserves. This system will:

1. Schedule patrols to optimize ranger coverage.
2. Record incident reports to track poaching trends and outcomes.
3. Monitor wildlife populations to identify vulnerable species and areas needing urgent intervention.

By improving data accessibility and coordination among conservation agencies, the system will contribute to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 – Life on Land, which focuses on protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. It aligns with Kenya’s commitment to wildlife conservation and the fight against illegal poaching.

### Scope

- Developing a secure and scalable database to store and manage patrol schedules, incident reports, and wildlife monitoring data.
- Integrating real-time data collection and reporting to enhance decision-making.
- Enabling data-driven strategies to predict poaching hotspots and deploy resources efficiently.
- Supporting collaboration between rangers, conservationists, and law enforcement for timely intervention.

### Key Objectives

1. To improve patrol coordination by scheduling and tracking ranger activities.
2. To enhance data accuracy through standardized reporting of poaching incidents.
3. To facilitate real-time communication between rangers, reserve managers, and enforcement teams.
4. To strengthen wildlife monitoring efforts by tracking population trends and habitat changes.

### Stakeholders

- Wildlife Rangers: Will use the system to access patrol schedules, report incidents, and receive alerts on potential poaching threats.
- Wildlife Reserve Managers: Will oversee operations, analyze data trends, and optimize resource allocation.
- Government Conservation Agencies (Kenya Wildlife Service - KWS): Will utilize the data for policy-making and anti-poaching initiatives.
- Law Enforcement & Anti-Poaching Units: Will use incident reports to investigate poaching activities and enforce regulations.
- Conservation Organizations & NGOs: Will leverage wildlife monitoring data to advocate for conservation efforts and secure funding.
- Researchers & Ecologists: Will access wildlife population data to study trends and recommend conservation strategies.
