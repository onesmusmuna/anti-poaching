# Anti-Poaching
Anti-Poaching Effort Management System

## Todo
Create a database to coordinate anti-poaching efforts in Kenyan wildlife reserves, including patrol
schedules, incident reports, and wildlife monitoring.

## 1. Project Idea Definition
Kenyaâ€™s wildlife faces significant threats due to poaching, illegal wildlife trafficking, and habitat destruction. Despite ongoing efforts, challenges persist in coordinating anti-poaching operations efficiently, managing patrol schedules, recording incidents, and monitoring wildlife populations. Rangers often arrive too late at poaching sites, making enforcement reactive rather than preventive. Additionally, human-wildlife conflicts and the demand for land for agriculture and settlement exacerbate the problem.

The proposed Anti-Poaching Effort Management System aims to address these issues by creating a centralized database for Kenyan wildlife reserves. This system will:
1. Schedule patrols to optimize ranger coverage.
2. Record incident reports to track poaching trends and outcomes.
3. Monitor wildlife populations to identify vulnerable species and areas needing urgent intervention.
